# MyReads

A bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

### Node

[Node](http://nodejs.org/) is really easy to install & now include [NPM](https://npmjs.org/).
You should be able to run the following command after the installation procedure
below.

    $ node --version
    v8.4.0

    $ npm --version
    5.4.1

## Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/royshouvik/react-nd-myreads.git
    $ cd react-nd-myreads
    $ npm install

## Start & watch

    $ npm start

## Simple build for production

    $ npm run build

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results. 

## create-react-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
